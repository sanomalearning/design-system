# Sanoma Learning Design System contributing guide

We would like to welcome all contributors.

These are the basic contributing rules:
- New branch should be created from the `main` branch
- Branch naming: `feature/issueNumber-...-...` or `fix/issueNumber-...-...`, eg `feature/21-button-component`
- Please use English for naming ðŸ™‚
- Every component should have prefix `sl-` eg. `sl-button`
- Please add unit tests for your changes
- Commit message with scope (eg. button, checkbox) for instance:
    `(button): Create button component`
- Before creating PR â€“ the newest version of `main` branch should be merged into feature branch and all conflicts should be resolved
- Squash before merge (GitHub  will do squash for you)
- Not merging PR without code review
